The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection 
===================

The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) acquired its first artworks in 1929, the year it was established. Today, the Museum’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art.  

MoMA is committed to helping everyone understand, enjoy, and use our collection. The Museum’s [website](http://www.moma.org/collection) features almost 60,000 artworks from nearly 10,000 artists. This research dataset contains more than 120,000 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum. Some of these records have incomplete information and are noted as “not Curator Approved.” 

At this time, the data is only available in CSV format.

### Research in progress
This data is provided “as is” for research purposes and you use this data at your own risk. Much of the information included in this dataset is not complete and has not been curatorially approved. MoMA offers the dataset as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind. 

We plan to update the dataset with new and revised information on a regular basis. You are advised to regularly update your copy of the dataset to ensure you are using the best available information.
